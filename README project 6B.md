# Project write-up: Libraries & Dev Environment
The Smart Contract code itself (.SOL files) does not require any external libraries.

My development environment utilizes several npm libraries:
* truffle Suite (Ganache & Truffle. Local Ethereum tools.)
* ganache-cli (Command Line Interface)
* truffle-hdwallet-provider (This is used to deploy for deploying to the Rinkeby test network via Infura.)
* http-server (for hosting web pages in Windows environment)
* truffle-blockchain-utils
* web3

Additional Dev tooling:
* Visual Studio Code, with Solidity Extension (by Juan Blanco)
* Chrome browser, with MetaMask plugin
* Infura.io Tools for working with Rinkeby and other networks.

## Additional Environment Notes
I open three Node.JS windows concurrently.
Window 1: (1_start_ganache-cli.sh)
Navigate to the project-6 folder and start Ganache:
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"

Window 2: (2_start_http-server.sh)
Navigate to the project-6 folder and start the http server:
http-server

Window 3: (3_start_Truffle.sh)
Use this window to compile, test and deploy the contracts. e.g.
truffle compile
truffle test
truffle migrate --reset --compile-all --network infura



# Project Overview
This simplified DApp provides a means of proving the authenticity of Fair Trade coffee, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain. 

This DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a Seller and Buyer. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A Buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally a Seller can mark an item as Shipped, and similarly a Buyer can mark an item as Received.

The app's implementation closely follows Project 6B's boilerplate code.

# Operation
With your http server running, visit one of the addresses that it is monitoring. I.E. One of these addresses:
  http://10.0.0.4:8080
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://172.29.192.1:8080
  http://172.28.170.17:8080

Ensure that MetaMask is running, that you are logged into it and that it is connected to the network where the contract is deployed. (And that your wallet has sufficient funds.)

Proceed through the supply chain process by successively clicking each step:
Harvest, Process, Pack, For Sale, Buy, Ship, Receive, Purchase.

Observe that the Transaction is populated as each transaction succeeds.
Open the browser's console (F12) and observe that the results of Fetch Data 1 and Fetch Data 2.
